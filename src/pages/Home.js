            <p>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sawyer, an engineer with a passion for crafting digital experiences through code. My journey into programming began in college when I wanted to learn how to create my own websites. I have experience with React, Node, and much more, just check out my <Link to='/skills'>skills page</Link> for a full list! I've had experience implementing & maintaining QA automation testing for one of the largest live selling platforms in the nation. I also enjoy creating personal projects in my spare time to advance my knowledge of both development & QA. You can check some of them out <Link to='/projects'>here</Link></p><br/>
