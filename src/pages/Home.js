            <p>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sawyer, a developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences through code. My journey into programming began in college when I wanted to learn how to create my own websites. I have experience with React, Node, any much more, just check out my <Link to='/skills'>skills page</Link> for a full list! I've had experience maintaining QA automation testing for one of the largest live selling platforms in the nation. I also enjoy creating personal projects in my spare time to advance my knowledge. You can check some of them out <Link to='/projects'>here</Link></p><br/>

            <p>While my bachelors degree is in Biology, I have recently completed a full stack developer bootcamp and am committed to continuous learning and growth. I love tackling complex problems and turning them into elegant solutions. One of my proudest moments was when I created a tool to check the status of android apps across 20+ developer accounts & return the names of apps in need of updates. There was no API available that suited our needs so I crafted a web automation tool using Codecept.js to search each account and return any apps in need of attention.</p><br/>

            <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my work, and let's <Link to='/contact'>connect</Link>! I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Thanks for stopping by!</p><br/>
